    &quot;I-shaped&quot;.The bone is now complete.Up to here for this time</p>

  <p class="s2">PAGE 49</p>
  <p><span><IMG width="520" height="424" src="1/Image_087.jpg" /></span><br />Parts are 65-67 for upper right.68-70 for

  <p class="s2">PAGE 50</p>
  <p><span><IMG width="520" height="250" src="1/Image_089.jpg" /></span><br />Paste 66a on 65 and add thickness.Paste
    67a on the back side, and<br />add thickness with 66b on the bottom side.Finally, the bottom side of the bottom is
    blindfolded with 67b, and it is completed.<br /><span><IMG width="520" height="340"
        src="1/Image_090.jpg" /></span><br />Similarly, 68-70 for upper left.Lower right 71-73.Make the lower left

  <p class="s2">PAGE 51</p>
  <p><span><IMG width="520" height="365" src="1/Image_091.jpg" /></span><br />Attach it to the base of the wing, between

    parts is drawn in gray on the starboard side.Attach it so that 187,188 is inserted from right<br />and left there.In
    addition, attach the cockpit floor 189 by inserting it from behind.</p>
  <p class="s2">PAGE 56</p>
  <p><span><IMG width="520" height="467" src="1/Image_100.jpg" /></span><br />Furthermore, 178 which is divided into
    right and left is inserted from right and left.Insert 180 and 181 from the top and then insert<br />179. The upper

  <p class="s2">PAGE 57</p>
  <p><span><IMG width="520" height="327" src="1/Image_101.jpg" /></span><br />Attach it so that the floor 190 &lt;191 at

  <p><span><IMG width="520" height="686" src="1/Image_105.jpg" /></span><br />Because the details are exessed by

    from incorporating the internal to the framework after all.<br />However, at this stage, we decided to attach the
    wing attachment frame to the body bone.(Because it seems that the inner and outer shells can be attached neatly ...)
    That<br />is the wing mounting frame this time.</p>
  <p class="s2">PAGE 63</p>

  <p>Now that we have the upper wing engine, we will build the lower engine.However, since the lower engine is also a

  <p class="s2">PAGE 106</p>
  <p>make holes for the legs.Insert the parts of the divider into the semicircle (note the front and back of the
    divider).<br /><span><IMG width="520" height="293" src="1/Image_202.jpg" /></span><br />The assembly here is the
    same as the one made before.The up and down direction of the engine is upside down with the engine above, but it is
    the same that the brown semicircle (369,412) with a partition arrives on the flat side opposite to the kamaboko

  <p><span><IMG width="520" height="364" src="1/Image_223.jpg" /></span><br />Check the condition by inserting it into

  <p><span><IMG width="520" height="356" src="1/Image_225.jpg" /></span><br />For 404, fold the lower end to make it
    valley-folded, then fold and paste it in the center and cut out.Insert this into the 403 so that the front and rear
    are not mistaken, and glue it at the slit.Next, glue the expanded part of the tip of 404 and the cut of 403 and
    paste<br />it on 401 + 402.<br /><span><IMG width="520" height="135" src="1/Image_226.jpg" /></span><br />The

    back side is also<br />wound around 456 in the order of 458 460 466 468 (only the 466 sticks out slightly
    behind).Designed with 0.22mm paper thickness.I think that it can be wound almost without gaps if it is wound tightly
    with 0.22mm thickness.Cut edge when winding (The joint is made to match at the bottom of the beam.)<br /><span><IMG

  <p>The semicircular parts at the tip are 463 and 464.Tips are necessary because they are small. First, make a 464 fold
    line, make a hole a little smaller, then cut out and fold the fold line.(2) When glue is applied to the back side of
    464, layer 463 on it and make a curve<br />with a thin iron bar.Glue the edges and stick them so that the left and
    right semicircular parts are raised. When it&#39;s dry, trim the hole with a file.<br /><span><IMG width="520"

  <p>I&#39;m going to roll the parts again to make a stick, but it&#39;s<br />difficult to roll them neatly.Yes, the
    parts are placed vertically so that they can be rounded up brilliantly. But lick the back and squeeze them with a
    thin stick. Roll the joints between fingers or<br />on a table. Various sticks are used.<br /><span><IMG width="520"

        width="520" height="192" src="1/Image_310.jpg" /></span><br />Parts for lower right wing (lower right) are
    523-553, and those for lower left wing (lower left) are 554-585.<br /><span><IMG width="520" height="222"
        src="1/Image_311.jpg" /></span><br />The assembly method is the same as the evious upper leftt laser cannon. But
    beware of one point !!<br /><span><IMG width="520" height="164" src="1/Image_312.jpg" /></span></p>
  <p class="s2">PAGE 154</p>
  <p>If you align all the joint lines like the upper wing leather method, the joint line will come to a ominent position
    of the barrel when completed.So paste 551a (583a) at the position rotated 180 as shown in the
    picture.<br /><span><IMG width="520" height="696" src="1/Image_313.jpg" /></span><br />Attach accessories.</p>

  <p><span><IMG width="520" height="223" src="1/Image_316.jpg" /></span><br />Parts are 599-611.We epared two patterns,

        src="1/Image_317.jpg" /></span><br />Make the body 602 cylindrical and cover with 603.The legs are glued

        width="520" height="123" src="1/Image_318.jpg" /></span><br />After attaching the head (599 + 600 + 601) and the
    bottom part to the body, attach the legs on the left and right and it is completed.</p>
  <p class="s2">PAGE 157</p>
  <p><span><IMG width="517" height="365" src="1/Image_319.jpg" /></span><br />It is small.<br /><span><IMG width="520"
        height="320" src="1/Image_320.jpg" /></span><br />I will line it up with X-wing.</p>
  <p class="s2">PAGE 158</p>
  <p><span><IMG width="520" height="293" src="1/Image_321.jpg" /></span><br />Rub the socket on the X-wing body with a
    round bar and mount the droid after adjustment.The legs are slightly viewed, so bend them<br />slightly inward and
    then just plug in.<br /><span><IMG width="520" height="391" src="1/Image_322.jpg" /></span><br />It fits like this.
    Thus, X-wing is completed.Thank you for your hard work.</p>
